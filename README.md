The repository for my CS-370 course at SNHU

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The work I did was finishing a portion of an artifical intelligence agent to solve a maze puzzle. Most of the code was already finished and included, this was the necessary imports, a basic matrix to act as the maze, as well as the actions and even the neural network were all provided. The section I had to work on and complete involved implementing a Deep Q-Learning algorithm to train the agent. I was provided some basic pseudocode to guide me, but the rest of it involved coming up with the necessary code myself to allow the agent to get a win rate of 100% through exploration vs exploitation.


### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists essentially create programs, applications, or other systems to help people and solve problems. Many of the things made by computer scientists have had an impact on peoples lives, even creating simple algorithms to sort to an incredibly large amount of data to make the lives easier of those who manage such data. On the more complicated end, like creating artifical intelligent systems that can be used in a plethora of ways from medical scenarios, games, disability assistance or other in home assistance. AI systems can be made and trained to do a large number of things, but over all these scientists can improve a lot of things for different people in different ways.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Generally I try to break down the problem into smaller parts as to not overwhelm myself, and as a way to fully understand the problem and the best way to solve it. It also helps to break things into smaller parts as I can more appropriately address each part individually as I work to completion of the whole problem. In instances where the problem isn't so clear cut, I try to analyze what it is I am trying to do, or for whom I am "working" for to help with their problem and figure out what it is they specially want solved. There is no one size fits all answer to how to approach a problem, so I would say "dynamically" would be how I approach a problem, as to adapt to the situation.

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Maintaining ethical integrity is critically important, if the systems, software, or application I create can somehow cause harm or problems to others then I have failed on my duties to ethical responsibilities. Not all ethical problems are always easily observed beforehand, so in the instance of launching a software that has unknown errors or bugs that may lead to problems with ethics, it is my responsibility to maintain this software and correct any problems within it as to not cause harm to others. This also comes into play when it isn't just "my neck" on the line if I was working with a larger organization. If I fail to maintain my ethical responsibilities it could have consequences for the orginization I am working for.
